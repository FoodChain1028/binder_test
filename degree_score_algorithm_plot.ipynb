    "- $G = (V(G), E(G))$ is the considered graph of users, where the vertices $V(G)$  represent the users and the edges $E(G)$ the fact that two vertices vouched for each other.\n",

    "- We think of $V(G)$ as the list $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots, |V(G)|-1\\}$, where we denote by $|V(G)|$ the cardinality of this set.\n",
    "- We call a vector $x\\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{|V(G)|}$, that is, a vector with $|V(G)|$ non-negative real entries, a *score vector*. It represents the values of the corresponding users.\n",
